# NAssetNameGenerator
Generate Random Names in .NET for use in naming assets similar to how docker names containers.  The generated names are easier to remember and type for a human than a random string.

.NET Port of name generation from the moby project: https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go (Apache 2.0 License)
rewritten to work in .NET and random integer range is expanded to deal with collisions better

Available on NuGet @ https://www.nuget.org/packages/NAssetNameGenerator/
